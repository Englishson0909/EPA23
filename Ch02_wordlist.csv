Whales, the largest animals on earth, swim to the deepest parts of the sea to feed and come up to the surface to breathe. While they are near the surface, they release waste from their body. This way, they bring essential nutrients from the deep sea to the surface waters. These nutrients form the base of all marine food chains and keep the marine ecosystem running.
Whales are also really important after they die. The dead  고래 body, also called “whale fall,” sinks toward the bottom of the sea and becomes food for many fish species that live in the harsh conditions of the sea floor. In addition, the dead body is good for the environment. As it has a lot of carbon in it, by sinking to the sea ﬂoor, it keeps the carbon out of the atmosphere. According to marine scientists, the amount of carbon that whales take to the bottom of the sea is about 190,000 tons annually, which equals the amount of carbon produced by 80,000 cars.
