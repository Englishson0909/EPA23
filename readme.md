## Study 2: Differences across first Languages ##

- Figure 9.7 plots the proportion of vocalic material (%V) produced by the German, Spanish, and Korean learners against the variability in their consonantal intervals (Varco-C)

- The data in the figure show that the rhythm metrics differ for the three L1 learner groups, with the highest Varco-C values for German and the highest %V values for spanish, as would be expected under L1 transfer - that is, a high number of consonants and low number of vowels in German a stress-timed language and vice versa in Spanish as a syllable-times language.

- The effect of L1 background on accentual and phrase-final lengthening for Levels B1 and B2, respectively. 

- German learners better at distinguishing between the prosodic lengthening of accented and unaccented final syllables than the other learners, at least at Level B1.

- At the level B2,with German learners differentiating less between the different syllable types, while the Koreans are doing better, and the spanish are essentially continuing as before.
- Although German learners with the most typologically similar language background to the target language showed an early advantage for some measures, they were often still as far off as the other L1 groups at the intermediate B levels 

- An ANOVA with fixed factors L1 language (German, Sapnish, and Korean), Level (B1 and B2), and Lengthening condition (unaccented, accented, unaccented final, accented final) showed significant main effects for all three factors respectively. 

- A significant interaction between language and Level, F(2,1683)=3.22, p<0.05, confirming the pattern of results. 

** We can conclude that the measures tested here can successfully distinguish between the spoken productions of learners from different L1 backgrounds. **



### Discussion ### 
Useful micro-level prosodic measures for consideration in L2 teaching and assessment context

Result 1: focus on differences across proficiency level, indicating that the learner speech observed at the different proficiency levels signaled progression form a more syllable timed realization of speech to a more stress timed realization, in line with the prosodic requirements of English,
More specifically, the higher level learners in the sample used here were found to 

Study 2: focused on learners from three typologically different L1 background at intermediate level proficiency, indicated that learners with 

These finding suggest that
1)   May be a prosodic basis to the results reported by Crowther et al. (2015)
-   Speakersâ€™ L1 plays an important role in listener judgements of L2 comprehensibility 
2)   A finding common to both studies
-   Variability within CEFR levels, with differences found mainly between Levels A1 and C2
-   No meaningful differences between adjacent levels
( pronunciation features are not clearly distinct between adjacent levels)

### Implication ###
Useful insights for learning, teaching, and assessment 
1)   The importance of global intelligibility 
-   Knowledge of components of pronunciation and an awareness of when, how and why a pronunciation features is problematic for leaners 
-   Aware of relevant phonological categories, able to name important errors
-   Important prosodic features such as syllable variability and the crucial role of vowel reduction could become a focus in the classroom (Liang, 2003, Low 2006) 
-   Different pronunciation features could be fruitfully emphasized in teaching and learning based on the L1 background of learners 

2)   Investigating measures 
-   Raters have reported lower confidence in assessing pronunciation as compared to other skills and more comfortable making global judgements of intelligibility as opposed to nuanced judgements about features of pronunciation 
-   Undemanding nature of judgement of global intelligibility in terms of technical expertise (Yeats et al., 2011;36) as opposed to the precise technical knowledge needed to deconstruct pronunciation into its constituent parts
-   The need for a comprehensive and in-depth training of examiners
-   The Role of L1 background in learner speech for international ear 

3)   Scale development 
-   Some confirmation of research that has reported difficulty in scaling pronunciation ability across six or more levels
-   Further empirical work is needed focusing on the scaling of pronunciation 

4)   Micro-level features identified impact on the development of descriptors in assessment scales
-   Suprasegmental features, specifically rhythm, play a distinguishing role at both higher and lower levels of L2 proficiency and should therefore be included at all levels.
-   IELTS scale 
-   Micro-level features can provide useful guidance for examiner training
5)   Automated speech recognition (ASR) and assessment system of speech in which pronunciation measurement play a central role. 
-   Most recent systems are based on detailed taxonomies of pronunciation features 
-   The finding of the effect of L1 background on rhythm can be useful for ASR, as they support the development of ASR systems targeted at specific L1s or language groups.
